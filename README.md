# Finnagen's ECS!

## ‚ùì| What is it?
ECS is short for "Entity-Component System."
It is a system where there is a space. In these spaces there are entities, which all contain components.
Many game development engines, such as Unity, run on this form of system.

## üíª| Usage!
This ECS system allows for multiple spaces to be created. Each space contains a list of entities and components.
You can create variables that function like normal variables, by assigning the value(s) in the `value` property,
as well as all the additional benefits of the Entity class!

You can assign these entities components, which can be used as a way to give your variables attributes!
Now, with roblox, you can assign the reference to be an Instance, and can access your entity through the linked instance,
and vice versa.

## ‚ùì| Why?
I mainly made this module just to simply test my ability to make a library. However,
I noticed the potential uses for it and decided to post it here. The main benefit, like I said before, is that you can
give your variables attributes, and still maintain their value, which opens up many new possibilities for your code!
